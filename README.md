# Challenge Fourteen: KN Tech Blog ![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

### For this challenge, I created the back end and front end of a tech blog website. KN Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog that allows users to publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions. By inputing their email, a username, and a password, users can create an account. Users must be logged in to add reviews and comments.

## Credits

### I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this application. I especially used what I learned in Module 13 and Module 14 and the code that was given through these modules as a guide for this challenge. Much of the code provided to use in these modules directly related to the code I wrote for this application. I used this post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23545838/session-timeout-after-inactivity-in-express-session-in-express-server) to figure out how to have a session time out if a user is idle. Styling code was taken from the Module 13 and Module 14 project, Deep Thoughts. The CSS code was only slightly modified from what was provided.
